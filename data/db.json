      "method": "The inevitable foundation for building up the flavor in this meal is to start by sauteeing the Onions. This should take about 3 to 5 minutes. The next thing is to stir in the tomato paste. This adds a deep and rich tomato flavor; I simply fry this for another 5 minutes or thereabout. Add the ginger and garlic and cook along with the tomato paste for another two minutes; Actually, by the time this is ready, you will notice it in the smell. If you keep it cooking any longer, you might risk burning them. Add the blended peppers. Usually, there is no particular time frame for frying this pepper. I often stop when the sauce becomes really thick, and the oil literally floats on top of the sauce. At this point, most of the water is gone, and the sauce no longer smells raw. Trust me, you will know, but just in case you are still in doubt, I would say maybe 15 to 20 minutes depending on the quantity of water in your blended pepper. Finally, in building my flavor, I add the thyme, curry powder, salt, white pepper (good but optional), and seasoning cubes. Adjust the seasoning at this point if there is a need to. Once the flavor is on point, then, stir the Rice. Make sure you stir the rice properly until you cover each grain of rice with the sauce. Now add the chicken stock. Give it a brief stir and cover it up with a tight-fitting lid. If your lid is not fitting enough, simply cover the rice with foil paper before covering it with the lid. This is because Jollof needs a lot of steam in order to turn out well. Once the rice comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low immediately and continue to cook until the rice is done, about 20 to 30 minutes. Serve with Fried Chicken, Spicy Grilled Chicken, Grilled Tilapia Fish, or Gizzards and plantains.",

        "1 teaspoon Baking Powder",
        "1/2 teaspoon Nutmeg"
      ],
      "method": "Tips for making the Meat Pie filling: Add the oil to a pan and saute the onions for about 1 minute. Add the ground beef and cook until it's well browned. Add the curry powder, thyme, bouillon powder (cube), and salt and mix together. Then stir in the carrots and potatoes. Cook till tender. In a separate bowl, mix the flour and water until smooth and stir the mixture with the filling (this will thicken the filling). Remove from heat and allow to cool. Tips for making the Meat Pie pastry: Combine the flour, baking powder, and nutmeg in a bowl and mix well. Add the Margarine and butter (or margarine alone if you choose to) and rub it with the flour until you get a crumbly texture – like Breadcrumbs then begin to add Cold Water, a little at a time until it forms a stiff dough. Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead for 1 minute then place the dough back in the bowl, cover it with a plastic wrap, and place it in the fridge to rest for about 30 minutes ( skip refrigerating if you want a less flaky pie). Let’s put them together: Roll out the dough to about 1/4 of an inch thick then cut out your desired size circles and distribute the filling inside each cut-out pie dough (don't overfill so you can be able to easily close the Pie). Crack an egg in a small bowl, add 1 tablespoon of water and whisk together then use a pastry brush to brush the edges of the Pie. Fold the pie over to seal (and crimp the edge if not using a pie cutter) and use a fork to create a couple of vents on the Pie (this will help prevent air pockets in your pie). Brush the surface of the Pie with the Egg wash and arrange the pies on a parchment paper-lined tray. Bake at 350°F for 20 to 30 minutes or till golden brown.",

      "method": "Blend the peppers and onions together – The first thing I like to do when making my Egusi soup is to blend the peppers. While blending the peppers, try to use as little water as possible so that the blended pepper will not turn out too watery. Note that, if your blended pepper turns out too watery, it will prolong the cooking time of the sauce. the Egusi seeds and onions together. I also use a little bit of water for this because it’s important for the Egusi to have a thick consistency. This will allow the resulting Egusi soup to be curdled and not scattered. Heat the palm oil but don’t overheat – I am not a fan of overheating palm oil. The term we usually refer to as ”bleaching” except in some recipes that the bleaching process cannot be avoided, like the ayamase stew, which is also known as the Ofada stew. Egusi soup is very easy to make. Add onions and locust bean: I added locust bean to my recipe hence, I skipped the addition of seasoning cubes. However, if you don’t like locust beans or you don’t have it handy, the stock will be sufficient to enhance the taste, or simply use the seasoning cubes to your taste. I also like to divide my locust bean into two parts. I add the first half while frying the Onions so that the flavor of the bean can get released inside the Oil. This process takes about 3 minutes. This is how to make the Nigerian Egusi soup. Add the blended pepper: Fry until it’s well cooked about 15 to 20 minutes, then add the Egusi melon. It is very important not to stir the Egusi at this point; give it time to curdle. Once it’s curdled for about 15  to 20 minutes, stir it briefly, then add some chicken or beef stock with the Meat or Fish of your choice and leave to cook again for another 15 minutes. The Egusi should be cooked at this point, but if you feel there is a need to cook a little longer, just add some more stock or water and cook for a few more minutes. Note: I usually leave my Egusi to cook for at least 30 to 40 minutes; longer cooking time is okay but not lesser. Add the remaining locust bean, beef stock, and salt to taste. Cover and leave to cook for another 5 minutes. Gently introduce the blended egusi inside the sauce but don’t stir it at this point. Just cover it and leave it to cook for about 20 to 30 minutes. Keep an eye on it, so it doesn’t burn but try not to stir it until the Egusi turns into a soft compact mass. Then, gently stir together and add more stock or water if necessary. Add the fish and meat and cook for another 5 minutes. Stir in the spinach and leave to simmer for about 5 minutes (stir constantly). Adjust the seasoning if necessary. Serve while still hot.",
